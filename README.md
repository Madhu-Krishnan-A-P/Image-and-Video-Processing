# Image and Video Processing – MATLAB Experiments

This repository contains a series of MATLAB-based experiments completed as part of the **"Image and Video Processing"** elective course in the M.Tech VLSI and Embedded Systems program at **Cochin University of Science and Technology**.

## 🔍 Overview

The experiments span foundational and advanced topics in image processing, providing practical insights into how digital images are analyzed, transformed, and enhanced.

## 🧪 Contents

| Assignment | Topics Covered |
|------------|----------------|
| Assignment 1 | Binary, Grayscale, and Color Image Analysis |
| Assignment 2 | Matrix Operations (Transpose, Inverse, Orthogonality, Unitary) |
| Assignment 3 | Point Operations (Negative, Thresholding, Contrast, Power-law, Bit Slicing) and Histogram processing |
| Assignment 4 | Histogram Processing & Equalization (Manual vs Inbuilt) |
| Assignment 5 | Smoothing Filters (Box, Weighted, Median – 3x3, 5x5, 7x7) |
| Assignment 6 | Image Sharpening (Laplacian, Unsharp Masking), Edge Detection (Sobel, Prewitt, Canny) |
| Assignment 7 | Frequency Domain Filters (Ideal, Butterworth, Gaussian – LPF & HPF) |
| Assignment 8 | 2D Discrete Fourier Transform – Manual vs Inbuilt, Properties Verification |
| Assignment 9 | DCT, Walsh-Hadamard, KL Transform, Image Reconstruction |
| Assignment 10 | Image Restoration: AWGN, Salt & Pepper Noise, Motion Blur, Atmospheric Degradation |

## 🛠 Tools Used

- MATLAB R2023a+
- Image Processing Toolbox
- No use of inbuilt functions where manual implementation was required

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each assignment is placed in a separate folder with:
- `.mlx` files for code
- Sample images (where applicable)
- Screenshots of outputs
- PDF reports

## 📈 Highlights

- Custom 2D DFT and property validation (linearity, shift, duality, etc.)
- Histogram equalization without `histeq()`
- Spatial and frequency domain filtering
- PCA-based image reconstruction using KL Transform
